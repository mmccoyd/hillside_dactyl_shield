# Readme

A breakout board for Dactyl keyboards
  with back panel battery and reset switches
  plus
  battery JST, two under glow indicator LEDs and display/Vik connector.
Headers for rows, columns, thumbs and external switches.
Header for socketing or pin soldering ProMicro footprint MCU.

Designed for the [Hillside Dactyl 50 xxx],
  but should be useful in any Dactyl with at least a
  modest case volume.

Size: fits under the index finger columns and display area of a choc Dactyl.

## Status

Currently only the right side PCB is designed.

Final version will have left and right PCBs in a frame.

## TODO

## Ordering

I've ordered it from JLCPCB with success.
Though I've not yet had them do the PCBA parts on it.

## Parts

see wiki for

MCU Headers

## Firmware

It's a tool to create different designs,
  but the Hillside Dactyl 50
  [ZMK firmware xxx] should be a useful template.

## Other breakouts

- A similar option but with the MCU built in is
[BastardKB](https://bastardkb.com/)'s [Splinktegrated](https://bastardkb.com/product/splinktegrated-rp2040-controller/)
