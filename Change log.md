## Alpha.2

### Known issues

-   Ground pins are hard to solder because of too many ground plane
    connections for a four layer board.
-   Opening solder jumpers requires cutting the trace,
    which is a pain to do and suspect on a four layer board.
    Better would be leaving all jumpers open and requiring they
    be soldered closed, even if closed would be the most common.
-   Creating the release PCBA files required manually rotating
    the LED transistor.

### Changes from Alpha.1

-   Panel of left and right side.
-   Four layer, though can still be built as two layer.
-   Bare or smart LEDs.
-   Split ESD protection.
