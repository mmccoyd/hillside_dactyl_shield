# Ordering

I've ordered it at JLC. The steps are:

PCB:

- Material: FR-4
- Layers: 2
- Thickness: 1.6 mm

- Confirm production file: yes
- Remove order number: specify location

PCBA:

- PCB Type: Economic
- Side: Top
- Qty: 5
- Tooling: Added by Customer
- Confirm parts: Yes

- Advanced: defaults

Bill of Materials:

The battery and LED power switches require the Standard PCBA process,
  not just the Economic one;
  but they're easy to hand solder if you want to do it manually.
If you select Economic PCBA,
  you'll get a warning about it missing data for those two switches, which is fine.

Upload the bill of material and position files from
 the pcba folder.
