# Design layout

This describes what should be in specific spots on the PCB.
The layout uses a 0.1 mm grid with an origin point centered between the
    PCBs to make a mirrored layout easier.

## Mirrored locations

The parts of the PCB that must fit to the case
    need mirrored locations on the left and right PCBs.
They are the:

-   Board edge 
    -   Mounting holes
    -   Power, reset, and split USB sides.
    -   Smart LED holes
    -   Dumb LED contact pads, maybe
-   Jacks: MCU and Split USB
-   Controls: Power, reset, and LED.
