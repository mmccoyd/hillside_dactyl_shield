# Part alternatives

Sometimes specific parts are out of stock at the PCBA house.
Here are possible alternatives at JLC.
It is the part parameters and reliability that matter,
  so often several alternatives are just as suitable.

But check the data sheet and PCBA placement and rotation.

- ESD: SRV05-4 SOT-23-6:
  - Extended Preferred by stock levels:
    - C20615829 4A 15V 80W 6V Unidirectional 5V   hongji acheng
    - C7420376  5A 12.5V 75W  6V Bi-Directional 5V   hongji acheng
  - Extended by stock level
    - C558418   3A 20V 6V 5V  TECH PUBLIC
    - C2836319 15V 60W 9V 5V  MSKSEMI

-   Isolation capacitors (Multilayer Ceramic (MLCC))
    -   Small 0402
        -   0.1 uF to 1 uF would be fine
        -   More uF is nicer as the impedance is roughly the same within 0402
        -   25v: 1 uF C52923
        -   16v: 0.2 uF C16772, 0.1 uF C1525,
    -   Larger 0805
        -   22 uF is likely way more than needed.
