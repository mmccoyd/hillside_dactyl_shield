# Export for fabrication

You can ignore this if you use the release files.

Exporting from source for fabrication involves

-   GitHub action to create Gerber and PCBA files using KiBot files in bin/.
-   Download the Gerber results from GitHub
-   Rotate the LED transistor manually.
    It is not rotating properly, so need to set to 180 manually.
-   Order at JLCPCB
